// This code is a React functional component called `QuizSite` that represents a quiz or questionnaire interface. Here's an explanation of its key components and functionality:

// 1. **State Variables**: The component uses several state variables to manage its behavior and data:
//    - `quizData`: Stores the quiz questions and answers fetched from an external API.
//    - `selectedAnswers`: Keeps track of the user's selected answers for each question.
//    - `score`: Holds the user's current score in the quiz.
//    - `currentQuestionIndex`: Keeps track of the index of the currently displayed question.
//    - `apiError`: Stores an error message if there's an issue with fetching data from the API.
//    - `userInfo`: Retrieves user information from Redux state using `useSelector`.

// 2. **Fetching Data**: The component uses the Axios library to make an HTTP GET request to an API (`https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=10`) and fetches quiz questions and answers. It then shuffles the answer options for each question using the `shuffleArray` helper function and sets the `quizData` state.

// 3. **Answer Selection**: The `handleAnswerSelect` function is called when a user selects an answer option for a question. It updates the `selectedAnswers` state with the user's choice.

// 4. **Score Calculation**: An `useEffect` hook is used to calculate the user's score based on their selected answers whenever `selectedAnswers` or `quizData` changes. It iterates through the questions and checks if the selected answer matches the correct answer for each question.

// 5. **Navigation**: The `nextQuestion` and `previousQuestion` functions allow the user to navigate between questions by incrementing or decrementing the `currentQuestionIndex`. These functions are used when the "Next" and "Back" buttons are clicked.

// 6. **Rendering Content**: The component conditionally renders different content based on various states and user information. Here are some key conditions:
//    - If there's an `apiError`, it displays an error message indicating that the API is not available.
//    - If the `currentQuestionIndex` is within the range of available questions, it displays the current question, answer options, and navigation buttons.
//    - If the user is not logged in (`userInfo` is falsy), it displays a message prompting the user to log in to answer the quiz questions.
//    - If the user completes all the questions, it displays their total score.

// 7. **Styling**: The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, including button styles and formatting text.

// 8. **Redux**: It uses Redux's `useSelector` to access user information from the Redux state (`state.amazonReducer.userInfo`).

// Overall, this component provides a quiz-like interface, allows users to answer questions, tracks their score, and provides conditional content based on user actions and API availability.
